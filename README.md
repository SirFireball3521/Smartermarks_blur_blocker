# Smartermarks_blur_blocker

Small userscript for blocking smartermarks from detecting tab changes. Not extensively tested, but it's worked so far.

Installation:
1. Install a userscript manager, such as Tampermonkey (available on Chrome and Firefox)
2. Open the main.user.js file and click "Raw", a window should open with a button to install. Click it.
